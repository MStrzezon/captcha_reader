# Captcha Reader using TensorFlow

This project focuses on building a Captcha reader using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework. The goal is to create a model that can accurately recognize and decipher Captchas, which are commonly used security measures in online forms to distinguish between human users and automated bots.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the Captcha reader consists of a collection of labeled Captcha images. These images are typically generated using various fonts, distortion techniques, and noise to make it challenging for automated systems to interpret them accurately. The dataset used in this project can be obtained from [insert dataset source or repository].
